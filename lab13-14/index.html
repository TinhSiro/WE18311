            Oh, I cannot explain
            Every time it's the same
            Oh, I feel that it's real
            Take my heart
<br>
            I've been lonely too long
            Oh, I can't be so strong
            Take the chance for romance
            Take my heart
            <br>
            I need you so
            There's no time I'll ever go
            Cheri, cheri lady
            Goin' through a motion
            Love is where you find it
            Listen to your heart
            Oh, I cannot explain
            Every time it's the same
            Oh, I feel that it's real

            Cheri, cheri lady
            Living in devotion
            It's always like the first time
            Let me take a part

            Cheri, cheri lady
            Like there's no tomorrow
            Take my heart, don't lose it
            Listen to your heart
            Cheri, cheri lady
            To know you is to love you
            If you call me baby
            I'll be always yours
            I get up, I get down
            All my world turns around
            Who is right? Who was wrong?
            I don't know
